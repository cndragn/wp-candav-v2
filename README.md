## Developing With npm, Gulp and SASS and [Browser Sync][1]

### Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you have installed Node.js and Browser-Sync* (* optional, if you wanna use it) on your computer globally
- Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
- Run: `$ npm install`

### Running
To work and compile your Sass files on the fly start:

- `$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpconfig.json` in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
{
    "browserSyncOptions" : {
        "proxy": "localhost/theme_test/", // <----- CHANGE HERE
        "notify": false
    },
    ...
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`
